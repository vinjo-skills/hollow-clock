# 3D Printed Hollow Clock Project

This project utilizes Arduino Nano along with a 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor and ULN2003 Stepper Motor Driver to create a hollow clock design. The clock is designed to be 3D printed, providing a unique and customizable look for your timekeeping needs.

## Features

- Utilizes an Arduino Nano microcontroller for precise control
- Incorporates a 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor for smooth and accurate clock movement
- Compatible with ULN2003 Stepper Motor Driver for efficient motor control
- Customizable 3D printed clock design for personalized aesthetics

## Components Required

- Arduino Nano
- 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor
- ULN2003 Stepper Motor Driver
- 3D printed clock components
- Additional hardware as needed (wires, screws, etc.)

## Installation and Setup

1. Connect the Arduino Nano to the 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor using the ULN2003 Stepper Motor Driver.
2. Upload the provided Arduino code to the Arduino Nano using the Arduino IDE.
3. 3D print the clock components according to the provided design files.
4. Assemble the clock components and mount the stepper motor in the desired configuration.
5. Power on the Arduino Nano and watch as your 3D printed hollow clock comes to life!

## Usage

- The provided Arduino code controls the movement of the clock hands, adjusting them to display the current time.
- Customize the code as needed to adjust the clock movement or add additional features.
- Experiment with different 3D printed designs to create a clock that matches your style and preferences.
